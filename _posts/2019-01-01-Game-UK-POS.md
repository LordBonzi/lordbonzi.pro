# This post is unfinished, but I've published it now as knowing me, I'll lose the document.

I recently took a trip in to [Game](https://www.game.co.uk/), somewhere I don't frequent much, and discovered they now sell Arizona Ice Tea (a rarity in the UK) and remembered I have a [](https://www.game.co.uk/reward), So I went and headed to the tills and asked the cashier to find my account on the system so I could save my points, payed for my drink, thanked the cashier and walked out

Once I'd got home I checked the [website](https://www.gamewallet.co.uk/), and didn't see it on there transactions page. "Bugger" I thought, So I checked the receipt and realized they'd used the wrong account. Fair enough.

Skip to a few days later and I find myself back in Game for another can (or two) of Arizona, armed with my [Loyalty card](https://www.game.co.uk/reward) on my phone.

Well, you see. There system is built from the ground up. They have some very good features.

For example, There [loyalty program](https://www.game.co.uk/reward) also acts as a "Pay-As-You-Go" top-up card for use with all there systems. You can add gift cards to it and use it just like one, In the event of a top-up and a gift-card being credited to an account being used for a transaction, the gift-card's balance will be used up first, than any stored credit from a top-up.

Any transactions you make with that [Loyalty card](https://www.game.co.uk/reward) are logged and can be accessed on the ["Game Wallet"](https://www.gamewallet.co.uk/) management portal.

Your [loyalty account](https://www.game.co.uk/reward) can also be used to login to there [eCommerce](https://www.game.co.uk/) platform where you can pre-order games, book time in there [eSports](https://www.belong.gg/) arenas, where you can go in-store or online and buy credits that can be redeemed for time in the arenas

I believe that all these features create a very good ecosystem for customers, and allows Game to retain there user base, as if they provide a easy and up to date experience for there customers, it gives them a reason not to go anywhere else
